                    <div class="values-content">
                        <p><em>"It is what it is!"</em></p>

                        <p>Acceptance, openness and gratitude are, in my opinion, essential elements for a good life.
                            Finding the way there is always a challenge. But increasingly, obstacles become signposts.
                        </p>

                        <p>Making this potential visible is a concern of mine in my work. I have no formula for success,
                            satisfaction or even happiness, but I have a large toolbox full of tools, experiences,
                            methods and models that will advance you.</p>

                        <p>What is the goal? There are interim goals and often we think everything will be better when
                            we have achieved them, only to find that a new goal immediately emerges. Nevertheless, we
                            can develop skills that strengthen us across topics and indeed make everything better!</p>

                        <p>Everything between birth and death is a self-writing story in which we play, or should play,
                            the leading role. We can only arrive at ourselves and fill our role in harmony with our
                            values and wishes.</p>

                        <p>This attitude is also reflected in my work. It is about steering development from the core.
                            To illuminate this, to accompany people, brands and companies in a development process is a
                            task that fulfills me, inspires me and always inspires me anew.</p>

                        <p>Coaching, training and moderation are interactive processes at eye level. Every encounter,
                            every process is new and exciting and I experience it as a gift.</p>

                        <p>My expertise, my experiences, my attention, empathy and strength are fully at your disposal
                            in our joint work. The expertise for the process, for building blocks, methods and models
                            lies with me. The answers, solutions and individual development steps lie within you.
                            Together we create clarity, define development directions and bring about sustainable
                            change.</p>

                        <p><em>At this point I would like to thank all my teachers, for all encounters and experiences
                                and for the trust that is placed in me.</em></p>

                            <p>Ms. Nicola Hemshorn accompanied a change process through moderation, group and individual
                                coaching. In all settings, she was a real enrichment for all participants, which was
                                evident not least in strengthened problem-solving competence. Her special ability of
                                structured moderation – complemented by an excellent grasp – has enormously enriched and
                                professionalized the work. We are very grateful to Ms. Nicola Hemshorn for her

                            <p>Dear Ms. Hemshorn,<br><br>When I think about what I am grateful for this year, the
                                encounter with you is definitely one of the most important events. Without you, I would
                                certainly have taken a different path. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the
                                intensive work and the new perspectives and ways of acting that you show me.</p>

                            <p>The coaching process with Nicola Hemshorn helped me a lot to look at my
                                self-understanding and my role in the company from new perspectives and thus gain a
                                clearer view of achieving my goals. Nicola combines a pronounced empathy with a broad
                                professional horizon. As a result, my coaching received a solid framework, but was
                                always flexible enough for improvisations when the situation required it.</p>
