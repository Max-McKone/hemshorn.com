                    <div class="values-content">
                        <p><em>"It is what it is!"</em></p>
                        
                        <p>Acceptance, openness and gratitude are, in my opinion, essential elements for a good life. Finding the way there is always a challenge. But increasingly, obstacles become signposts.</p>
                        
                        <p>Making this potential visible is a concern of mine in my work. I have no formula for success, satisfaction or even happiness, but I have a large toolbox full of tools, experiences, methods and models that will advance you.</p>
                        
                        <p>What is the goal? There are interim goals and often we think everything will be better when we have achieved them, only to find that a new goal immediately emerges. Nevertheless, we can develop skills that strengthen us across topics and indeed make everything better!</p>
                        
                        <p>Everything between birth and death is a self-writing story in which we play, or should play, the leading role. We can only arrive at ourselves and fill our role in harmony with our values and wishes.</p>
                        
                        <p>This attitude is also reflected in my work. It is about steering development from the core. To illuminate this, to accompany people, brands and companies in a development process is a task that fulfills me, inspires me and always inspires me anew.</p>
                        
                        <p>Coaching, training and moderation are interactive processes at eye level. Every encounter, every process is new and exciting and I experience it as a gift.</p>
                        
                        <p>My expertise, my experiences, my attention, empathy and strength are fully at your disposal in our joint work. The expertise for the process, for building blocks, methods and models lies with me. The answers, solutions and individual development steps lie within you. Together we create clarity, define development directions and bring about sustainable change.</p>
                        
                        <p><em>At this point I would like to thank all my teachers, for all encounters and experiences and for the trust that is placed in me.</em></p>

                            The <strong>BIP (Bochum Inventory for Job-Related Personality Description)</strong> and 
                            innovative <strong>PHR (Pro Human Resources)</strong> systems enable a comprehensive assessment

                            in personnel selection and enables targeted, individual development of your employees.

                            <p>With her appreciative, analytical perspective, Nicola Hemshorn succeeds in gaining the trust of clients and searching for individually suitable solutions in a structured but always sensitive manner. Since 2014, I have experienced how she engages and sensitively enters into conversation with young people, opens up new professional perspectives and specifically promotes their implementation within the framework of the Hamburg Training Award. Exchange and reflection with her are always stimulating and purposeful.</p>

                            <p>Messages are only convincing when they are not only delivered but also "lived" by the seminar leader. Some words and conversations remain firmly in my memory. Thank you very much for this!</p>

                            <p>After a long and exhausting school day, I meet an open-minded seminar leader, Nicola Hemshorn, who integrates me into a still unfamiliar group with her empathetic manner using creative methods.</p>
                            <p>Through her clear and transparent structuring of complex content, she succeeds in opening me up to and inspiring me about the topic "Mindfulness and School".</p>
                            <p>Her clever questions and deepening suggestions help me to deal with my own feelings and thoughts.</p>
                            <p>I feel well taken care of and mindfully accompanied at all times.</p>
                            <p>With a good feeling and a treasure trove of ideas, I drive home inspired.</p>
