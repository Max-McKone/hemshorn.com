                <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
                <p>As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with ¬ß 7 Para. 1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to ¬ß¬ß 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.</p>

                <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
                <p>Our website contains links to external websites of third parties over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.</p>

                <h3>Copyright</h3>
                <p>The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution, and any form of commercialization of such material beyond the scope of copyright law require the written consent of its respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is identified as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.</p>

This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.</p>

                <p>We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>

                <p>We expressly object to the use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials.

                <h3>Privacy Policy for the Use of Google Analytics</h3>
                <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help analyze how you use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, if IP anonymization is activated on this website, your IP address will be shortened by Google beforehand within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>

                <p>Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.</p>

                <p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent. You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>

                <h3>Privacy Policy for the Use of Google +1</h3>
                <p><strong>Collection and Sharing of Information:</strong><br>
                Using the Google +1 button allows you to publish information worldwide. The Google +1 button provides you and other users with personalized content from Google and our partners. Google stores both the information that you have given +1 to content and information about the page you were viewing when you clicked +1. Your +1s may appear as hints along with your profile name and photo in Google services, such as in search results or in your Google profile, or in other places on websites and ads on the Internet.</p>

                <p>Google records information about your +1 activities to improve Google services for you and others. To use the Google +1 button, you need a globally visible, public Google profile that must at least contain the name chosen for the profile. This name is used in all Google services. In some cases, this name may also replace another name that you used when sharing content through your Google account. The identity of your Google profile can be displayed to users who know your email address or have other identifying information about you.</p>

                <p><strong>Use of Collected Information:</strong><br>
                In addition to the purposes explained above, the information you provide is used in accordance with applicable Google privacy policies. Google may publish aggregated statistics about users' +1 activity or share it with users and partners, such as publishers, advertisers, or affiliated websites.</p>
